## Opportunities and Risks â€“ Python & Jupyter for Capacity Analytics

Before diving in, I want to **re-emphasize** that this is a **proof of concept** â€” the focus is on the potential of Python in capacity analytics, not the benefit time analysis.  
We completed that analysis earlier and used it as a baseline to guide expectations.

### ðŸ”´ Key Risks:

- **Data Security & Compliance**  
  Bank of America enforces strict controls over who accesses data and how it's stored or shared. Any new tool must align with governance and compliance policies.

- **Tool Limitations**  
  Python and Jupyter are powerful, but they cannot fully replace tools like **SAS**, **Excel**, or **Tableau**, especially for more advanced or embedded workflows.

- **Change Management Resistance**  
  New tools often face resistance due to existing preferences and learning curves. Adoption may take time and require training.

### âœ… Key Opportunities:

- **Unified Reporting**  
  Jupyter brings **code, analysis, and documentation** into a single notebook â€” improving transparency, reproducibility, and audit readiness.

- **Extensive Analytical Toolkit**  
  Python supports advanced modeling, forecasting, automation, and data visualization that go beyond traditional spreadsheet tools.

- **Cost Efficiency**  
  Python is **open-source**, reducing licensing costs compared to commercial tools like SAS and Tableau.

- **Repeatable Automation**  
  Scripts can supplement Excel/SAS by automating workflows and reducing manual errors â€” enabling consistent, scalable analysis.

- **Model Governance Readiness**  
  As capacity analytics moves toward a more model-driven approach, Python enables us to start designing **controlled, auditable workflows** that align with risk and compliance frameworks.

In summary, while Python isnâ€™t a replacement today, it represents a **strong first step** toward a future of **automated, transparent, and model-driven** capacity planning.
